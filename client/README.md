### Overview

For this assignment, I created a memory game with React.  

The application renders different images (of similar international countries' flags) to the screen.  

Each image listens for click events. The app keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br> 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
